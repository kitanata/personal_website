<p>So here I am again trying desperately to explain to my client, why their
critisims of my code, although warranted are also, not important. With this
particular client, we've come to an impasse where no code can enter the code
base until the entire team has picked it apart and searched for perfection
within. They think this is good, because it prevents bad code from entering
the codebase, but what they don't realize that this process is an 
absolutely horrible way to approach software development. I'll explain.</p>
<h1>From Fear Through The Eyes of Madness</h1>
<p>At some point in this project's past, this client had a real big problem with
code quality. There is some pretty clear indication in the code base
that a few people went on wild refactoring missions that ended up Javaizing
code. That would be fine, if the codebase was written in Java but it's not.
This particular code is an amalgamation of Python and Bash. Java idioms have
no place within it. There is also evidence in the code base that Test Driven 
Development was not a huge thing when the project first started, and has 
gradually moved to be more test driven.</p>
<p>At some point along the line, the team decided enough was enough and that they
were tired of code entering the codebase that had any potential to break anything.</p>
<p>So they implemented Code Reviews.</p>
<hr />
<p>In general I'm a big fan of code reviews when they are used as a touchpoint 
within the team. Code reviews have a big benefit of saying "Hey, this is what I 
worked on. This is what I changed." It gives the who, what, when, where, and why
about changes to the code. It also allows other members of the team to ask 
questions about the code. "Why did you write it that way?" and "What does 
that function do?" It can become a platform for teaching. All of this is 
important for the purposes of communication and skill growth within the team.</p>
<p>But that is not how this client uses Code Reviews and I suspect, this isn't how
most teams use code reviews.</p>
<p>This team uses code reviews as a gatekeeper to block changes to the codebase. If
someone on the team doesn't agree with an implementation then it is discussed and
argued over until a compromise is made. Suggestions are offered like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">-</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Use feature X of the language rather than feature Y here.&quot;</span>
<span class="o">-</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Don&#39;t write tests like that.&quot;</span>
<span class="o">-</span> <span class="s2">&quot;This should be a global variable.&quot;</span>
<span class="o">-</span> <span class="s2">&quot;This shouldn&#39;t be a global variable.&quot;</span>
<span class="o">-</span> <span class="s2">&quot;We should use the visitor pattern here rather than a decorator.&quot;</span>
<span class="o">-</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Using a generator here doesn&#39;t make sense. It&#39;s YAGNI.&quot;</span>
<span class="o">-</span> <span class="s2">&quot;This function should be extracted into another class.&quot;</span>
<span class="o">-</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Singletons should NEVER have state.&quot;</span>
<span class="o">-</span> <span class="s2">&quot;That variable name needs changed to Z because it isn&#39;t descriptive enough.&quot;</span>
<span class="o">-</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Write it this way ... not that way because of X, Y, and Z.&quot;</span>
<span class="o">-</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Deriving a class in this way violates Liskov Substitution Principals&quot;</span>
<span class="o">-</span> <span class="s2">&quot;This code has more than one responsibility.&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If you are on a team like mine, then these suggestions probably seem reasonable to you,
and they should. The dangerous thing about this, is that these suggestions are 
often not-wrong. There is a lot of give and take when it comes to writing software. Good
code in one case, is bad code, or at least sub-optimal code in another, and having feedback
from the team is one way to increasing the quality of the code. It's good to do code reviews
like this because it prevents this bad code from entering the codebase at all, right? </p>
<hr />
<p>Wrong. Code reviews like the ones with the suggestions above are harmful.</p>                </article>
