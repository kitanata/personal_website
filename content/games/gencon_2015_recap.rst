Superman
========

Sometimes I think I am Superman. This year I was invited by my publisher to come join them at their booth in the exhibit hall to demo and promote my game Corrupted Kingdoms. Excitedly I accepted. Who turns down an opportunity to demo their games at Gencon? The only problem is this, I co-organize a conference for the Python programming language. Unbeknownst to me, this year PyOhio (the other convention) overlapped Saturday and Sunday with Gencon. I had made a huge mistake.

Normally when I overbook something I try to cancel one or the other things, but not this time. There was no way to bail on either Artana (my publisher) or my team at PyOhio. I needed to be demoing and promoting Corrupted Kingdoms and I needed to present on some tech stuff at PyOhio. I couldn't bail. I had to do both.

The plan was simple. Drive into Indy on Wednesday, get my badge, and help setup the booth. After dinner head back to the room and send out some emails and marketing for PyOhio. Demo the game Thursday and Friday. Leave Friday night. Sleep. Do PyOhio setup Saturday morning. Give my presentation around 10:30am, help cleanup and run a couple of other things, and then leave to head back to Gencon. Demo all day Sunday. Drive back home, (again), and get ready for work Monday. 

Simple. Right?

Day 1 - Wednesday
=================

I drove into Indy wednesday morning. After the relatively innocuous 3 hour drive between Columbus and Indy I reached the convention around 2pm and took up a spot at the mall parking lot next to the convention center. Running about 15 minutes behind schedule I left everything I brought with me in the car and called Nils so I could get my badge for the exhibit hall.

After running from the parking lot to Exhibitor HQ, I met up with Nils and got my badge. Nils was soaked head to toe in sweat. The lanyard for my badge, which up to this point has been around Nils' neck is equally drenched. I tell him how disgusting it is to have someone elses sweat on my badge and grab another from the Gencon staff. 

Entering the exhibit hall was like hitting a wall head on. 110 degrees and 90% humidity permiates the air. The fans aren't even running. Immediately beads of sweat started pouring out me. For the rest of the day we worked in this heat setting up the booth. Ocassionaly I had to sit down out of fear of collapsing to take a break. I am incredibly out of shape, so this entire experience put me physically way outside of my depth. Luckily our friends at Game Salute came by to drop off a case of water. If they hadn't I think I would have died from heatstroke. Each of us went through about 10 bottles of water. 

After we set everything up we got together around 7PM at a 50ish diner with lots of flair, slow service, and decent food. A heafty amount of incredibly fullfilling conversation ensued. I met a ton of really great people for the first time who was helping us out at the booth. We headed back to the hotel shortly after and played The New Science and Tesla Vs Edison to make sure our demoing skills were solid on those games. I started getting a headache and had to bail early. I went back to my room, took a much needed shower and laid down for what I had planned to be only a minute. 

I passed out almost immediately.

Day 2 - Thursday
================

In the morning I realized my mistaken slumber had betrayed my committment to the other organizers of the other convention back in Columbus. I was supposed to write up a set of eratta, room, and scheduling changes to be set inside the swag bag we give our attendees. I realized then it probably wasn't going to make it into the bag, and we'd just have to wing it on Saturday. I had to be in the hall for the VIP Gamers who had an hour early access to the hall.

I spent about 30 minutes setting up Tesla Vs. Edison and Corrupted Kingdoms to get the booth ready for the army of gamers that would soon be upon us. Despite the heat from yesterday. Winter was coming and with it, the undying hordes of D20 affociandos.

I demoed an earlier post-art prototype of Corrupted Kingdoms at Origins earlier this year. There, I often had 10 to 15 minutes between each game session. At Gencon I had very very little downtime. It was unrelenting, demo after demo, and laughs after laughs. Don't get me wrong. I'm not complaining. I think it's awesome that so many people wanted to play my game. I had a blast, I just wasn't prepared for it.

Around 2:30 in the afternoon my stomach decided it couldn't subsist solely on the energy drinks Nils had supplying us throughout the day. (Pina Colada Rockstar is amazing, I learned.) I made a B-Line for the food trucks and stopped to get a box of Indian food which although not impressive in quantity definitely made up for in taste. I think they were running thin on product. I sat under a tent and ate my food before heading back to the booth.

On my way back I stopped by Stronghold games to pick up a copy of La Granga which was the only new game I was really excited about this year besides Tesla Vs. Edison (I picked up Kanban and Flick em' Up at Origins). I also passed by David Lee Pancake's booth to pick up a hand sculpted dice box resembling a Mimic which I had preordered from him on Facebook. It did not disappoint and is currently taking up residence next to my collection of WoD, Shadowrun and Indie Press (Fiasco/OLBH/Dread) on my bookshelf. Amazing craftsmanship on David's part.

For the rest of the day I demoed Corrupted Kingdoms to around 20-30 people until the Exhibit hall closed then returned to my room around 6pm to relax and punch out La Granga. I was too tired to read through the rules so I laid down for a quick 20 minutes nap.

I got up around 1am just as my roommate returned. My quick nap turned out to be not so quick and now, partly awake decided to take a shower, and find some water and food to help with the splitting headache I was again experiencing. So I began a quest. At first I talked to some of the hotel staff for suggestions on someone that might be open. No luck. Rolling a +5 to wit I asked if they had a hotel store with some snacks turned out to be successful however, when I was directed to a large bottle of Aquafina and a large bag of Chex Mix. Score!

I wandered the convention center for a couple hours passing by several Villages who were each inextricably engaged in mass genocide, driven by nothing more than fear and suspicion. I wanted to join in, as I usually do at Gencon and Origins but realized I did not have any generics to make it feasible. So I hung out and cheered on a couple of my friends and aquantiences. 

Eventually I wandered back to my room around 4am and took another "short" nap.

Day 3 - Friday
