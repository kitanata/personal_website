Destiny
=======

I think I was destined to be a game designer. It is less so now, but in my childhood we were a close knit family. Every couple of weekends my grandmother would summon my mother, my aunts and uncles, and few friends over for dinner. We started noon, and every couple of hours new people would arrive. My grandmother and whoever she had chosen for her evening Sous Chef would take up the tiny kitchen and begin preparing our evening meal. The rest of the adults would take a seat at the long oak dining table and begin the evening with a simple deck of cards. Given we all lived in Ohio, Euchre was a common choice. Sometimes Rummy would follow. As the sky outside got darker and darker eventually Scrabble or Monopoly hit the table. Ocassionally so would Life.

Being children, and thoroughly versed in play we often begged and cajoled the adults into letting us join in their games. Eventually, one weekend, shortly after I turned 8 or 9, I was allowed to join. The first game I ever learned was Rummy. I fell in love at 9 years old. I got pretty good at the game by the time I turned 10. In time, I learned the other game night staples and started developing preferences for games. Every weekend I would attempt to persuade the adults to let me play Monopoly with them; usually I failed. Over time, I think they became annoyed with me, because after awhile they stopped letting me play with them.

But I would still ask "Can we play a board game?". Such is love.

Eventually they bought me a few board games that I could play with my sister, although it was pretty rare she would oblige (or rather humor) me. I remember one day, when my cousins from out of town visited I was able to get them to sit down and play Payday with me. I do not remember why, or what happened but an argument insued and the game was destroyed. I was destroyed. For years I couldn't get my sister or family to play with me, other than my old standby Rummy.

Until One Day...
================

When I was in high school, I wasn't a very popular kid. At some point, I ended up at the "losers" table. I wasn't very happy with this, but as I started making friends with the other outcasts (nerds, goths, and geeks among them) I learned they liked to play games. This made me happy. There were three very dominant games. #1. A Vampire the Requiem LARP, that was one part vampires, and another part Jackie Chan Adventures. #2 Was Pokemon. and #3 Was Magic: The Gathering. Through all the stuggle of fitting in in High School and trying to find out who I am, and what I wanted to be. The feeling of being lost was finally gone. I had found my people. I opted for 1 and 2.

Truthfully though, the tabletop games and Jacki Chan Vampire LARPS took a backseat to the video games. Up until 2001/2002 my gaming console was my imagination, a SNES, The Original Gameboy, or an old PC. I was never a hardcore gamer. I owned maybe 5 or 6 different games. Many of which I played over and over again. I eventually convinced my parents to buy me a PS2 and for the first few months the cackles on my neck would stand straight up every time I turned on the console. The graphics were beautiful. The sound was amazing. The immersion was greater than anything I've ever experienced with games.

But eventually, I got bored with it. Where was the problem solving? Where was the puzzle? Where was the challenge? I felt like I was living inside of an illustrated and glorified coloring book. These games were nothing like the ones I had on my SNES. They just weren't any fun. At least not to me. So from there on the challenge was to do better. I wanted to know how to make games.

-- As an interesting aside, I eventually came to learn of the term "Interactive Storytelling", which describes the ongoing trend in the video game industry of focusing on storytelling, sometimes to the point that play gets lost in the process. In 2006 "Interactive Storytelling" was the hot thing in video game design. I had the honor of attending a very heated panel at GDC, the same year, where I watched Chris Crawford (a notable video game designer) passionately warn that "Games are dead" and then get scorned and scolded by about every single person in the room. I just nodded silently and thought "No. He's right. They've been dead for awhile." I think a lot of people missed the point. Luckily we have the indie scene making games like Minecraft to satisfy the growing desire for play in our "Interactive Stories". --

Around 2003/2004 I came across a piece of software called the RPG Toolkit, which was being developed by a graduate student up in Canada. There was an extensive community of game makers and hobbists who made some very, very complex games with this toolset. I joined that community and started making my own games as well. Eventually I hit a wall and had to learn RPGCode which was a scripting langauge to assist in more complex logic that couldn't be accomplished as easily through just the GUI. At about this same time I became a Junior in high school and was now allowed to take computer programming courses at the local business center (which was attached to our school). I learned visual basic, and then C++ and bought books on how to make simple games in these languages.

As I neared closer and closer to graduation my interest in game design and development grew. It was settled. I wanted to make games. I graduated high school in 2004. At the time there were only 3 colleges in the US which taught courses in game development: Digipen, Fullsail, and Westwood. I looked closely at all three and being mostly ignorant of the differences between the different schools opted for the one furthest away from home in sunny Winter Park, Florida.

-- As another aside, for all the flak that Fullsail gets in the game industry, or in the press, I will defend their game development program vigorously. I have never experienced anything as challenging mentally, up to that point in my life, nor have I ever since. I learned exactly what I wanted to learn, in the time I wanted to learn it, by incredibly talented and passionate people. It is not an easy program, by any means. --

Learning from a legend
======================

I never played Dungeons and Dragons. I knew of it. I knew people who played it. But I never indulged. About a quarter way through the Game Development program at Fullsail I learned that one of our teachers was the co-creator of Dungeons and Dragons. My classmates would joke at how they would bow down before Dave Arneson exclaiming "We're not worthy." in a cultish form. At Fullsail, Dave taught a class called "Rules of the Game" which was about the mechanical and dynamic aspects of games. The point of the course was to make you think about how all the rules and enviornmental constraits of a game system would come together to form the game itself. His lectures were long, and hypnotic. Sometimes they would put you to sleep, but when you woke up you somehow knew how to design games.

Dave was very much interested in the dynamics of player interaction, and "emergent" game design. Emergence is the idea of taking simple, basic rules and structuring them in a way that when they come together they form very complex game states. The GIPF project is an excellent example in emergent game systems. Dave would often reiterate to our class that a "perfect" game would be something that is simple to teach and hard to master. I have never forgotten that.

Dave's labs in his course consisted of tabletop games. This is where I was first introduced to games like Catan, and Muchkin. Dave's course is significant to me, not just because of how great of a teacher he really was but because he re-introduced board games to me. I was suprised that these games existed at all, and I fell in love with tabletop games all over again. It was in his class that I decided that I wanted to be a tabletop game designer.

In one of Dave's lectures he talked about how Klaus Teuber designed Settlers of Catan. He talked about how Klaus was searching for a game that he could play with his family. How he would introduce mechanics. Try them out, see them fail, and throw the game on the shelf for a few months before retweaking the components and torturing his family with another playtest. I don't know how much of the story is true, but when Dave was asked how long it took Klaus to design Settles of Catan he very quickly answered "Somewhere between 7 and 10 years, I think."

The start of something great
============================

I started designing what would eventually become Corrupted Kingdoms in 2008. It was initially called "Red Tape" and was a card game. I wanted Red Tape to be a game where players could be ruthless to each other and engage in Machiavellian style poltics. I wanted players to be able to use cunning and wit to decieve, extort, blackmail, and betray each other. And most importantly I wanted the game to be fun for *everyone* who was playing. Like Dave, I was interested in the dynamics of player interaction.

Shortly after I started working on Red Tape, a whitepaper came out from by K. Robert Gutschera called "Characteristics of Multiplayer Games". It was presented at GDC in 2009. In it, K Robert talks extensively about political behaviors in multiplayer game design. There are good behaviors that you may want to see in games like extortion, and backstabbing as well as negative behaviors like lying low, and kingmaking. One thing that stood out to me from this paper is something which K Robert dubs "Arbitrary Targeted Interaction".

According to K Robert, Arbitrary Targeted Interaction is when a game offers a player the ability to arbitrarily target an opponent for reasons not directly related to the game. It is a political dynamic that occurs in many multiplayer games. It is often caused by games providing poor or unclear paths to victory to players, or from a logical elimination of the player from the game. In some games, this game dynamic is seen as positive, but for a lot of players (especially ones who may become a victim to the poltics) it's not very fun.

There are a lot of examples in Gutschera's paper on basic games that exhibit political dynamics between players. Among these are King of the Hill sorts of games where there is a leader and other people are vying for the power to be a leader, another example is a kind of voting game, where you get to pick which player is eliminated through a vote, (Werewolf anyone?). Gutschera also lists a ton of different behaviors that are found in these kinds of games. Some of which I thought were positive like backstabbing and extortion and some I thought were negative like Kingmaking, Gangup Strategies, and Lying Low.

So now I had my challenge. I wanted to create a political game, about politics, where players would backstab, exort, betray, and decieve each other, but when the game was over noone felt they were unfairly targeted, ganged up on, or betrayed. I wanted to simulate the "it's just business" attitude that polticians have when they engage in Machiavellian politics. I wanted to make a game about Diplomacy that didn't end friendships.

Corrupted Kingdoms
==================

I struggled for a long time in the early development and the design of the game. Very early on I realized that to create these sorts of behaviors there had to be partial shared interest in game state between players. Players needed goals that overlapped between each other in a way where the game state enabled alliances between players, and where those alliances were balanced. From this came the Secret Agendas.

The Secret Agendas were by far the hardest thing to balance in this game. If they are given our randomly to players at the start of the game, and there are more agendas then there are players how do you ensure that one alliance doesn't form which is more powerful than another. For example, if 3 players support the same goal and 1 player doesn't. Then that one player is at a significant disadvantage in a multiplayer game. The gang up might not be overt, but it is still there.

I went through over 10 different iterations of Agenda cards while designing Corrupted Kingdoms. It wasn't until Dirk Knemeyer came onto the project that we ended up solving the balance issues with these cards.

Finding a Partner
=================

I had the very fortunate experience of working with Dirk on a prior company of his, where I was consulting for him on a software development project. I had heard through the grapevine that he was also working on designing tabletop games and had even published a couple of them. So after 4 and a half years of working on Red Tape own I reached out to Dirk to see if he was interested in publishing the game.

One rainy, August evening Dirk and I sat down and played Red Tape at the Columbus Area Board Gaming Society, where we are both members. Luckily for me Dirk liked the game enough that he wanted to publish some from of it. We laid out a few ground rules to working together and started on redesigning Red Tape into what would become Corrupted Kingdoms. Over the course of the last few months we've brainstormed, redesigned, reworked, and playtested the hell out of this game to make it as perfect as it could possibly be.

TODO: Working with Dirk.

Epilouge
========

After 8 long years of design and development, I believe I've accomplished what I set out to do. It is possible to create a game about poltics with positive political behaviors, where noone feels victimized, there are no unfair advantages, and everyone has fun in the process. Dirk Knemeyer and I have done it.
